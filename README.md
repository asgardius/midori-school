# What is a Genshin Killer?

From my point of view, a Genshin Killer is an Anime RPG which include elves among its playable Characters. This term is used since Genshin Impact gained popularity. Midori in the Magic School is a Genshin Killer because most of its playable characters are elves. Genshin Impact has 3 playable characters that look like elves (+1 upcoming one). Honkai Impact 3rd has a playable elf (Elysia). Wuthering Waves also has an elf as a playable character (Yinlin, a tribute to Kimberly Arch from Midori in the Magic School). Honkai: Star Rail has a playable dragon girl that look like an elf (Lingsha). Tower of Fantasy is not a Genshin Killer because that game hasn't playable characters that look like elves. Somebody else might have another point of view about this term, but won't be used here. This is a Genshin Killer, not a Genshin Like

# Why this game doesn't have builds for Microsoft Windows? Most players are using that OS

Microsoft Defender has an antifeature known as Smart Screen, which flags every unsigned executable as malware. ALSA Audio Calibration feature doesn't work on that OS. Most developers don't release their games for GNU/Linux, but i'm using GNU/Linux as my main OS. I don't follow trends, i want something better. If you want to play this game from Windows, you can use Google Play Games for Windows, but you will get much better results using virtualbox. In other words, something that Nintendo employees hates (Emulaation)

# Why a 2d game?

I don't have experience creating 3d models, but i have experience drawing on paper. For this reason a drawing tablet, GIMP and Krita are a perfect combo for me. After doing some tests, alpha builds from this game can be played on Steam Deck for 10 hours, while mainstream 3d games like Cyberpunk 2077 can be played for 90 minutes. A videogame created for handheld devices is focused on fun mechanincs, not fancy graphics

# How much text have in-game dialogs?

Almost nothing. If you want to know game plot, you can read it separately as an ebook

# Why your game looks like a Paul Klee Painting?

Because Midori Asgardius loves fireworks. You know, because this is a Genshin Killer

# About Falcighol Stealth Anticheat System

This game is the first to use Falcighol Stealth Anticheat, an anticheat system based on integrity check which is part of game code. Some player actions will trigger an integrity check, if checksum match, you can play without issues. If checksum mismatch, game will crash. You can use memory scanners to check current game data, but you must avoid changing some value, otherwise checksum will fail and this game will crash. Popful Mail for Sega CD has a similar anticheat system, and cheaters must change unchecked variables to cheat without crashing that game (hp meter is only checked value on that game, but you can set infinite ressurrect elixir instead). A 4 player LAN mode is planned. This anticheat system will be used at Asgardius Online MMO (that game may be ready at Half Life 4 release day)

# What is virtualxrpg?

Virtualxrpg is the codename used for this game. This is an attempt to create a Role Playing Game based on Asgardius Virtualx. I tried creating one with Page Asgardius as Main Character, but i ran out of ideas. My second attempt was a photorealistic RPG (something like Zelda's Adenture for CDI) with 2 playable elf girls. These characters became Pamela and Lety. My third attempt is a minimalistic Anime RPG with an elf girl that loves fireworks (Inspired by Lily Klee from Genshin Impact: 4th Honkai). This is the reason why this game is promoted as a Genshin Killer

# Why you don't have accounts at mainstream "Social Media"?

Because that is not a true social media and it's too mainstream. Remember that i don't follow trends

# Why you aren't using Unity for this game?

Because Unity is a closed source tool, and it's too mainstream. I'll learn to use Unity and Unreal, but i won't use them on Asgardius Virtualx Videogames (those will use open source engines only)

# Which smartphone is better for this game?

This game is made to  work better on linux smartphones like Pinephone (the one that i use) and librem 5

# Why Android release arrived too late?

I had issues trying to make this game working  on Pinephone,  so i delayed touch controls implementation until this issue was solved. Android support for this game is not a priority for me, for this reason i suggest using a linux-first smartphone instead. remember that Google Play reviews any app update, so every android  release  will arrive a bit later than linux releases

# How i can install this game on a Huawei Smartphone?

Android release is only available at Google Play because most android users find apps there. If you have a degoogled android device you need something like Aurora Store

# How can install this game on my Pixel with Graphene OS?

If you want a privacy focused smartphone, you must use a librem 5 instead, but you can use my hint for Huawei users

# Why this game is not available at F-Droid?

This is not a priority for me, but if you want to maintain a f-droid release, i won't stop you

# Why Ultrawide Screen support does not work on Android?

It's because most current Android devices have notched screens, something that Linux smartphones like Pinephone doesn't have

# System requirements

# Known devices that fit  these requirements

* Pinephone (Requirements were made to fit this device)
* Pinephone Pro (Untested)
* Librem 5 (Untested)
* Raspberry Pi 3b or later (Untested)
* Almost any X86_64 computer (Don't expect seeing this game ruunning on a Pentium 2 with a Voodoo card, because i'm not John Carmack)
